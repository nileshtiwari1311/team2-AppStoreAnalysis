"I absolutely love this app, I have found and used a lot of useful pins for my house, pool & deck. I have also found some great recipes. Some were delicious and I have made several times & some didn't live up to the hype. I love trying out new recipes even if they don't taste good to me. Great app, I...
Full Review","Love having everything at my fingertips! All the great ideas from creative minds in one app...perfect!!

Full Review","Pin has been very kind and generous with time by guiding me slowly through their product, helping me become educated in the various opportunities, and presenting me with ideas and tools so that I can implement as I see fit.

Full Review","I love this app! It's so addictive because there's always something interesting available so I'm on it at least once a day. From DIY Projects and cooking hacks to fantastic art and nerdy posts about all of my favorite books and shows that are just endlessly entertaining and inspiring! It brightens m...
Full Review","The latest update for this app has degraded its quality greatly. Shrinking images to fit inside tiny blockframes is not a good design whatsoever. When this element is reverted to its previous form without the shrinking to fit in frames with text blocks under it, my rating will return to five stars E...
Full Review","I can find literally everything with this app, I use it constantly. I absolutely love it for exploring new recipes, diy projects, hobbies, well, actually, exploring it all. So many things that I have never seen or had or thought of, etc. & I am sure there is still thousands upon thousands of things ...
Full Review","I really enjoy it, but its frustrating that it doesnt want to swipe at times. I would also give it five stars if it didnt give so many picrures in other languages. And if i accidentally click on one it just gives more in other languages. Otherwise its really amazing.","It's even pathetic now; as it get slower to load, while I can update the app in merely within seconds!! It's getting irritated while any update available in Google Play Store, Pinterest suddenly starts behaving strangely, like freezing, not updating random photos, saving a pin twice to the same grou...

Full Review",Easy to find what I'm looking for. I like the organization with boards and sub-boards. Easy to use from a phone. I don't like that the search option doesn't always come up when I need it but barely an inconvenience. I also love the ability to change my notifications.,"The select function is working fine, although it can't select to download image just to share. Kind of a bummer!

Full Review","In general I have no problems with the app. What I absolutely don't like is those pins that when you open the pin a video completely unrelated to for instance the recipe you want to look at, starts playing or there are so many adverts it takes ages loading that which you want. I immediately close th...

I am never disappointed. There's something for everyone, from foodies to Crafters, collectors and the world is bizarre entertainment!","I like the app and the content it provides but there are two things that tick me off: One.

It was a great help to get ideas for a walk in shower, tile options and tips. Now I'm looking again as need to repaint the main bedroom. Last painted in 2009","It's getting a bit much now with all the adds, soon there's going to be more adds than actual pins, we now get music while looking at pins which is terrible,plus many of the pins have no information or links, like items you like but can't purchase, I don't want to see a pair of shoes or coat that i ...

Full Review","While it's all fine and good to get lost down that rabbit hole that is Pinterest, the pins that come with auto playing music are annoying. What's up with that? And no matter how many times you click on the ad options to stop seeing it in your feed, Pinterest brings it right back. It would be nice if...
Full Review","Getting to find new things you've never seen, heard of or tried before is so interesting and I love Pinterest for it. However, it is glitchy and the ads are awful. If you find a board with an engrossing topic, it isn't unlikely to have to back out and start from the beginning because an add will pop...
Full Review","This has been a great app to have...I just love Pinterest and everyone who pins on it. Good people with such creativity and talent. Also it is such a great marketing tool to have handy. Whenever I get new inventory in for my online shop, I will pin some pics to let people know what I have available....
Full Review",I was very happy with Pinterest and really enjoyed but over the last 2 weeks I can not access any of the recipes. There is no longer a link to do that. Very very very disappointed! If it is not fixed soon I'll take this app off!,"Hi, I hope you're fine. Actually, I love this app a lot, but recently, when I open it none of the photos or videos are visible. I just see the color-frame of them and sometimes their captions. I can't have access to my own boards because I can't see the photos. I thought if I update it, the problem ...

Another thing,there are so many that don't say you have to sign up with them until you look at the site. Some of the sites jump from one add to anot...
Full Review","I absolutely love pinterest as it's the easiest place to get inspiration for just about ANYTHING. If there were a premium ad-free version I'd happily pay for it.

(Retired). Very interesting and easy to learn suggestions. Love it!!!","The overall performance of the app is great. It's just that nowadays, the recommended pins to me are a bit far-fetched from the things I search in the app. Pleasr fix it to actually have good and relevant recommendations.

Full Review","A pretty good app, I use it all the time to pin all sorts of pins I like and it's useful to be able to categorize everything where I want. p.s. wish that the explore page wasn't the first thing you see opening the app, but your account page or give the option to choose.","I'm a little upset at the some of the inconsistencies of certain features.
